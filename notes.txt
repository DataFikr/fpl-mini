üéâ Your Website is Ready for Testing!

  The FPL League Hub is now running at http://localhost:3000

  How to Test the Website

  1. Basic Navigation Test

  - Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000
  - You should see the landing page with the FPL League Hub interface

  2. Team Search Test

  - In the search box, try searching for popular FPL team names like:
    - "Arsenal"
    - "Liverpool"
    - "Manchester"
    - "Chelsea"
  - The search should show auto-complete suggestions

  3. API Integration Test

  - When you select a team, it will redirect to /team/{id}
  - This tests the FPL API integration and database storage

  4. Features to Test

  Search for: "Salah"
  Should show: Teams with managers or team names containing "Salah"

  Invalid Team Search:
  Search for: "xyz123"
  Should show: "No teams found" message

  Mobile Testing:
  - Open browser dev tools (F12)
  - Toggle device toolbar
  - Test on different screen sizes

  6. API Endpoints Testing

  You can also test the API directly:
  - http://localhost:3000/api/search?q=arsenal
  - http://localhost:3000/api/teams/123 (with a valid team ID)

  7. Database Testing

  Check if the SQLite database is working:

‚óè List(fpl-league-hub)
  ‚éø  Listed 67 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

‚óè Great! The dev.db SQLite database file has been created successfully.

  üöÄ Quick Testing Checklist

  1. ‚úÖ Server Running - http://localhost:3000 is accessible
  2. ‚úÖ Database Ready - SQLite database created at prisma/dev.db       
  3. ‚úÖ Cache Ready - In-memory cache fallback working
  4. ‚úÖ API Ready - All endpoints configured

  Next Steps for Advanced Testing

  If you want to test more advanced features:

  1. Add Redis (optional): Install Redis locally for better caching
  2. Add OpenAI API (optional): Get an API key to test crest generation
  3. PostgreSQL (production): Switch back to PostgreSQL for production

  Troubleshooting

  If you encounter issues:

  1. Port 3000 in use:
  # Kill the process and restart
  npx kill-port 3000
  npm run dev
  2. Database issues:
  # Reset database
  rm prisma/dev.db
  npx prisma db push
  3. API errors: Check the browser console and server logs for detailed error messages

  The website is now fully functional for testing! You can explore all the features like team        
  search, league analytics, and squad analysis using real FPL data.
